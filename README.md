## Stock Portfolio Optimization

# Project Overview
This project aims to optimize a stock portfolio by selecting high-performing stocks from the S&P 500, ensuring diversity across various industries. It involves extracting and analyzing stock data, conducting equity research, performing financial analysis, and optimizing portfolio risk and return.

Key Features
Diverse Stock Selection: Identified four high-performing stocks from the S&P 500, ensuring a diverse representation across various industries and analyzing their correlation.
Data Extraction: Extracted stock data using the Yfinance library in Python for precise and up-to-date information.
Equity Research: Conducted comprehensive equity research through SWOT analysis, industry analysis, and company-specific evaluations to gauge stock performance.
Financial Analysis: Performed in-depth financial analysis and Monte Carlo simulations to quantitatively measure company performance.
Portfolio Optimization: Optimized two tailored portfolio versions, high- and low-risk, based on volatility and expected returns.
Risk Assessment: Developed a Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) using Python to understand the relationship between each stock in the portfolio and the market, enhancing risk assessment and portfolio optimization.
